                <h3>Rules of the Game “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?”</h3> <br>

                <strong><em>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</em></strong> is a quiz competition where contestants have to
                correctly answer a series of multiple-choice questions in order to advance to the next level / question.
                There are 15 questions in total and each question is worth a specific amount of money and no time limit
                is
                placed on contestants to come up with an answer. Contestants also get three Lifelines to assist them if
                they
                get stuck on a particular question.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Who Wants to Be a Millionaire questions are structured according to five different Levels with each
                level increasing in difficulty. Each level contains three questions.

                <br>
                <br>
                Questions that are grouped into the same level will all be of similar difficulty. For example: Questions
                1-3
                make up the first Level and will contain the easiest questions. The second Level (Questions 4 – 6) will
                be
                slightly more difficult, followed by the third Level (Questions 7 – 9). The fourth Level (Questions
                10-12)
                will consist of really difficult questions, followed by the fifth, and last, level (Questions 13 – 15)
                that
                will pose the most difficult questions of the game.

                <br>
                <br>
                It’s important to remember that the questions which make up each level will not necessarily relate to
                the
                same or even similar topics, but their overall level of difficulty will be the same. Also note that the
                question Levels should not be confused with the Safe Havens or the Question Value Structure that are
                both
                explained below.

                <br>
                <br>
                There are three ‘safe havens’ in the question structure (Questions five, ten and fifteen). Contestants
                accumulate money with each correct answer, but should the they answer incorrectly before reaching a safe
                haven, they stand to lose a large amount of winnings. Below is a summary of the question value
                structure:
                <br>
                <br>
                Question 1 <strong> <em>$100</em></strong>, Question 2 <strong> <em>$200</em></strong>,
                Question 3 <strong> <em>$300</em></strong>, Question 4 <strong> <em>$500</em></strong> <br>
                <br>
                <h6>Question 5 - $1,000 Safe Haven.</h6>

                If contestants get this question wrong, they leave with nothing. If this question is answered correctly,
                contestants are guaranteed $1,000 even if the answer incorrectly before reaching the next safe haven at
                Question 10.
                <br><br>
                Question 6 <strong> <em>$2,000</em></strong>, Question 7 <strong> <em>$4,000</em></strong>,
                Question 8 <strong> <em>$8,000</em></strong>, Question 9 <strong> <em>$16,000</em></strong> <br> <br>

                <h6>Question 10 - $32,000 Safe Haven.</h6>

                If contestants get this question wrong, they leave with $1,000. If this question is answered correctly,
                contestants are guaranteed $32,000 even if the answer incorrectly before reaching Question 15.
                <br><br>
                Question 11 <strong> <em>$64,000</em></strong>, Question 12 <strong> <em>$125,000</em></strong>,
                Question 13 <strong> <em>$250,000</em></strong>, Question 14 <strong> <em>$500,000</em></strong> <br><br>

                <h6>Question 15 - $1,000,000</h6> <br>

                <h5>Lifelines</h5>
                Contestants are allowed three Lifelines that they can use at any point during the game. Each Lifeline
                can
                only be used once.

                <br>
                <strong>50/50</strong> – removes two wrong answers from the multiple-choice selection, leaving the
                contestant with only one correct and one incorrect option. This means they have a 50/50 chance.
                <br>
                <strong>Ask the Audience</strong>– the audience is asked the same question as the contestant and a quick
                poll is done to show their answers. If the chart shows a clear majority for a specific answer, this
                Lifeline
                can be extremely helpful, but it’s still up to the contestant whether or not to go with the results
                obtained
                from the audience.
                <br>
                <strong>Phone a Friend </strong>– Contestants are allowed to make a 30-second call to a friend or family
                member and ask them if they know the answer to the question.
